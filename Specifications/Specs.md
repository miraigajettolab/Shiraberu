# 1. Introduction

This project is a web-based spaced repetition system to facilitate the process of kanji learning for russian speaking users.

### 1.1 Project Specific Definitions and Acronyms

 **SRS** - [Spaced Repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) System - a set of rules to implement spaced repetition. Detailed SRS description could be found [here](https://github.com/miraigajettolab/Shiraberu/blob/master/Architecture/SRS%20description.md)
 
 **Vocabulary** - Written words in Japanese
 
 **[Kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji)** - Chinese characters used in Japanese writing system. User needs to know kanji to learn Vocabulary.
 
 **Kana/Hiragana/Katakana** -  [Syllabaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabary) that form parts of the Japanese writing system.
 
 **[Radicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(Chinese_characters))** - Graphical components of Kanji. User needs to know Radicals to learn Kanji 
 
 **Mnemonic** - In this case, a story that aids information retention.
 
 **Prototype** - Definition of Vocabulary, Kanji or Radical using a data structure defined [here](https://github.com/miraigajettolab/Shiraberu/blob/master/Architecture/Data%20types.md). Prototypes are created by technical writers.
 
 **Item** - Object reviewed by user using the SRS system. Created for every existing Prototype for every user (If there are 1000 total prototypes and 1000 users then we will store a million objects of this data type). You can think about an item as a projection of a prototype for every user. Data structure defined [here](https://github.com/miraigajettolab/Shiraberu/blob/master/Architecture/Data%20types.md). Items are created for every prototype, when user is created and. If new prototypes are added after user creation, then new items are automatically created for every existing user as well.
 * Note: from now on (unless specified otherwise) Prototypes and Items could be used interchangeably to mean an object that user learns or reviews.
 
 **Level** - Items are subdivided into levels to create a more structured experience for user and gamify the learning process. User can learn an Item only after reaching the level of that prototype.
 
 **Lesson** - One of two main activities that user can engage in. From user's standpoint this is the process of becoming familiar with the item, reading explanations about meanings/translations/readings/etc. From a data standpoint learning means changing *srs_stage* from 0 to 1, setting *due_at* to current [unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) + [stages[1].interval](https://github.com/miraigajettolab/Shiraberu/blob/master/Architecture/srs-intervals.json) and setting *learned_at* to current unix time.
 
 **Review** - The other one of two main activities that user can engage in. From user's standpoint this is the process of testing the recall of an item. From a data standpoint it works like this:
* Item is reviewed when its **due_at <= Current [Unix Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)** 
* After item's review **srs_stage** is incremented if it was successful. And equals to current_stage - (current_stage >= 5 ? 2 : 1) if failed.
  * After **srs_stage** is updated and is < 9, **due_at** is set to current unix time + [**stages[srs_stage].interval**](https://github.com/miraigajettolab/Shiraberu/blob/master/Architecture/srs-intervals.json)
  * If **srs_stage** is 9 then **burned_at** is set to current unix time. The item is considered to be remembered and is no longer reviewed.
  * all **..._rev_...** fields are set according to the success/failure of a review.

### 1.2 Intended Use

The user will use the site (shirabe.ru) to interact with items (radicals, kanji or vocabulary) in Russian and Japanese.

###### Major actions user can do with items are:
  * Learn an item (Lesson)
  * Check if user still remembers an item after some time and decide when to check again (Review)
  * Browse Items by levels and Look up items
  * Add user created content to an item (notes and synonyms)

###### Users have levels, so do items
To unlock next level's items user has to level up. To move do so user has to bring **srs_stage** of 90% of current level's kanji to pass (level 5).

### 1.3 Scope

The scope of work is:
* To develop:
  * Backend to store and manipulate data
  * Utility that will help to fill the model with [prototypes](https://github.com/miraigajettolab/Shiraberu/blob/master/Architecture/Data%20types.md)
  * Fronted web application for the User, which will be able to do *major actions* described in **1.2**
* To test all parts along the way using Unit Testing and Integration Testing
* To Add several levels of about 100 *production grade* prototypes per level to the service using utility developed earlier
* Test the user experience (by developers and/or real users) and gather feedback

# 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 User Needs

During lessons user needs to be able to clearly see all relevant data, we will try to pay attention to this need during frontend development.

During reviews user has several needs:
* During the review session user will have to input information in both hiragana and cyrillic. UX will be much better if we could eliminate the need to switch between input methods. This need will be solved using a subproject called [KiKana](https://github.com/miraigajettolab/kikana) that will enable user to input hiragana using cyrillic.
* If user intends to input one of accepted values but makes a typo during review's meaning check. We want to automatically understand that it's a typo, not a mistake and mark review as correct. We have to find distance between the input and each accepted meaning and decide if we should accept it as a correct answer. We will use a modified [Damerau Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance) algorithm to solve it.
* User needs to be able to add his own synonyms and notes to an item during review.

User needs to be able to have access to each item for reference.
* We will create a page for each item. User will have two ways to access it - through look up (search bar) and browsing by levels.
* Each item page should have statistics of past reviews, timestamp of next review, user added content and other relevant data.

Item pages should enable user to add his own synonyms and notes to an item.
